Year **2009** - Windows 7 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by Microsoft. 
  It was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became generally available on October 22, 2009.[9] It is the successor to Windows Vista, 
  released nearly three years earlier. It remained an operating system for use on personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, 
  tablet PCs and media center PCs, and itself was replaced in November 2012 by Windows 8, the name spanning more than three years of the product. 
  Until April 9, 2013, Windows 7 RTM provided content such as security updates, software updates, PC driver updates and technical support, 
  after which installation of Service Pack 1 is required for users to receive support and updates. Windows 7's server counterpart, Windows Server 2008 R2, 
  was released at the same time. The last supported version of Windows based on this operating system was released on July 1, 2011, 
  entitled Windows Embedded POSReady 7. 
  On January 12, 2016, Microsoft ended support for Internet Explorer versions older than Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7.[10][11][12] 
  Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, over ten years after the release of Windows 7, after which the operating system ceased receiving further support or 
  security updates to most users, and all PCs that blocks Windows Update on Windows 7 versions newer than KB4499164 released in May 2019 displays a full-screen upgrade 
  warning notification with an information page link starting from January 15, 2020. A support program is currently available for enterprises, providing security 
  updates for Windows 7 for up to four years since the official end of life.[13] However, Windows Embedded POSReady 7, the last Windows 7 variant, continues to 
  receive security updates until October 2021.
